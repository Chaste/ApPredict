# ApPredict - Action Potential Prediction 

This project is an extension of Chaste that is intended to be used 
for simulation of drug action in cardiac electrophysiology models. 

## Prerequisites

Before using this code you will need to download and install Chaste's
dependencies and the Chaste source code itself.

Please see [Getting Started] for details of how to do this 
(follow instructions for "Development Code User" to keep up to date with the latest code, or a release version if you want longer-term stability).

## Installation

This repo must be cloned into
```sh
<chaste source directory>/projects/ApPredict
```
so that all the file paths can be picked up correctly (replacing ```<chaste source directory>``` with the place you have put the Chaste source code). Alternatively, you can put a sim link from the above folder to wherever you clone this repo.

This ApPredict project should be used with the current `develop` branch of [Chaste](https://github.com/Chaste/Chaste). If instead you want a version that works with a released version of Chaste, then please select the relevant Tag of this github repository.

The following instructions should do the cloning, note that this project pulls in a submodule from the [Chaste/cellml](https://github.com/chaste/cellml) repository, so **cloning it requires the ```--recursive``` option**:
```sh
$ cd <chaste source directory>/projects
$ git clone --recursive https://github.com/Chaste/ApPredict.git
```

### Older git

N.B. on really old git versions (<1.6.5), `--recursive` doesn't work and you need to do:
```sh
$ cd <chaste source directory>/projects
$ git clone https://github.com/Chaste/ApPredict.git
$ cd ApPredict
$ git submodule init
$ git submodule update
```
