/**
 * Common code to allow this to be run as a test via scons and also as a
 * executable application from the apps folder.
 *
 * This class provides all of the functionality behind the ApPredict executable
 * and is used to generate simple APD90 predictions based on conductance block
 * of the ion channels specified in the constructor.
 *
 * The class can also use a Lookup Table to generate thousands of APD90 predictions
 * very very quickly, to create Bayesian 'credible intervals' (a bit like confidence
 * intervals) around the model APD90 predictions, at each concentration.
 * These are based on the input data uncertainty, as characterised in the paper:
 * Elkins et al. 2013  Journal of Pharmacological and Toxicological
 * Methods, 68(1), 112-122. doi: 10.1016/j.vascn.2013.04.007
 *
 * For most details of using this class, please compile and run the ApPredict executable,
 * and it will provide a 'help' style output of the command line arguments to use.
